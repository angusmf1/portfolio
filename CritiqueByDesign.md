I chose to critique this visualization because I am very interested in sports data and analytics, especially football. Sports data visualizations can often be difficult to understand and sometimes missleading so I chose an example of one to critique and redesign. This graphic certainly fits the mold of being hard to understand, even for its intended audience of football fans and analysts. I wanted to redesign this graphic to make it more accessible to a general audience and show that even obscure sports statistics can be easily understood with the right visualiation.

### Part 2. Critique the data visualization
