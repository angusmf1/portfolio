## Final project: Fighting the Fentanyl Epidemic
My final project focuses on the ongoing fentanyl epidemic in the United States. It provides a brief overview and description of fentanyl and provides visualizations that highlight the alarming growth of fentanyl-related overdose deaths and death rates. It then covers the growing illicit fentanyl trafficking and drug seizures into the United States, highlighting morbid facts and statistics. It uses a map visualization to illustrate where exactly fentanyl is entering the country by rank order. Finally, the presentation highlights harm reduction and other resources. It provides a call to action that inspires the audience to support and spread awareness for harm reduction resources, sign petitions against fentanyl, and support ongoing legislation.
