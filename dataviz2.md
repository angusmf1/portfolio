This bar chart of the general government debt is one method of displaying the data.

## Grid of line charts

I used Flourish to redesign the general government debt bar chart from above into a new data visualization using a grid of line charts that draw connections to sparklines. This visualization displays each government's debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995-2021.


## Grid of Gauges

I created this third visualization using a grid of gauges to illustrate the government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021. A gauge is appropriate for capturing a single value per government and symbolically illustrates to the audience that the higher the gauge reading, the larger the number. I used a yellow-orange-red color palette that fits naturally with the gauge. The more red the gauge reads, the higher the government debt. The color red has a generally negative association, therefore pairing it with debt was natural. The title "Under Pressure: Government Debt-to-GDP ratio continues to climb, 2021" further asserts that larger numbers are negative. I also displayed the debt-to-GDP ratio as a percentage per government, using the same color palette for the numbers as well. Therefore, the color of the percentage matches the gauge reading. I chose a light gray background for the visualization to complement the gauge's color palette and reduce eye strain. The visualization was designed for the highest/most-red percentages to catch the audience's eye. Therefore, the visualization should easily convey the story that Japan and Greece have far and away the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021, which is a negative and problematic dilemma.


## Discussion

The three different visualizations tell different stories about the data. The bar chart and the grid of gauges both show the government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021. However, the bar chart does not draw any conclusions about the meaning behind the numbers and is generally bland. I created the third visualization to tell the story that large ratios, such as Japan's and Greece's, are negative and problematic. The title, use of a 'pressure gauge', and associated color palette make the audience think of rising pressure, all conveying this message in a creative and visually appealing way. The second visualization differs by showing how these ratios have changed from 1995-2021. While the other two visualizations depict one-year rankings, the second shows interesting trends over time. Therefore, the second visualization would be more preferable if telling the story about these trends was the priority. Both the second and third visualizations use color in a more effective way and use symbolism to help convey their stories (sparkline for a heartbeat and gauge for a pressure gauge).
