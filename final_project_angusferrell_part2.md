# User research 

## Target audience
> My approach to identifying my target audience

The target audience that I hope to reach with my story are every concerned American citizen. This includes students, parents, siblings, friends, and co-workers. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview were finding three people that fall somewhere in these categories. I selected a parent/artist in their 50's, a working professional in their 30's, and a student in their 20's.

## Interview script
> The goals from research and related questions:

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Find the audience's perception of fentanyl | What is your perception of fentanyl in the United States?|           
|Find the audience's initial obervations of my shorthand storyboard | What is your first obersvation?  |
|Is my call to action clear? | Can you describe to me what the purpose of the visualization was? |
|What should I keep/what works well?  | What do you like about it? |
|What should I change?  | What would you change? |


## Interview findings
> The findings from my interviews and key takeways

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|What is your perception of fentanyl in the United States? |  Fentanyl is an epidemic in the USA and an emergency issue that needs to be dealt with immediately. The overdoses and the mixing of it into other drugs as wells as over the counter pharmaceuticals is a huge issue. Many people are exposed without intent            |             |             |
|What is your first observation? |  The presentation visually guided me through the written material. The graphs which impacted my understanding of the content the most were the graph of the overdoses and then the graph which expanded as I scrolled down through the topics.|            |             |             |
|Can you describe to me what the purpose of the visualization was?   | As a visual learner I understand that information communicated in multiple forms is better absorbed by the reader. Not only were there many on point photos of the topic being explored, the visuals had an interactive and animated component             |             |             |
|What do you like about it? | I like the depth of the presentation complete with qualitative data, yet also real life examples of the complexity of the situation all conveyed visually. I like the design of the dark, urban concrete look. The map of the USA with the trafficking route also make a great interactive element             |             |             |
|What would you change?  | The only thing I might add if possible would be a short video of a victim or expert in the subject just to bring even further depth to the information             |             |             |
