# User research 

## Target audience
> My approach to identifying my target audience

The target audience that I hope to reach with my story are every concerned American citizen. This includes students, parents, siblings, friends, and co-workers. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview were finding three people that fall somewhere in these categories. I selected a parent in their 40's, a working professional in their 30's, and a student in their 20's.

## Interview script
> The goals from research and related questions:

| Goal | Questions to Ask |

|Find the audience's perception of fentanyl | What is your perception of fentanyl in the United States?|           
|Find the audience's initial obervations of my shorthand storyboard | What is your first obersvation?  |
|Is my call to action clear? | Can you describe to me what the purpose of the visualization was? |
|What should I keep/what works well?  | What do you like about it? |
|What should I change?  | What would you change? |
