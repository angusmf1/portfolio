# Changes made since Part II
> Reflecting on the changes that I made from the completion of Part II to Part III.



I made several changes to my shorthand visualization based on the grading feedback comments provided on my Part II submission. First of all, I changed my reference page to generate a more standard reference style for each citation. Second, I touched up my call to action by providing clearer labels and reducing the number of buttons to a smaller, more manageable number. This should help focus my audience's attention on the resources, petitions, and legislation that I really want them to care about. I also made edits to my flourish line plot to highlight Fentanyl in red and put the other drugs in greyscale in order to further highlight its rapid increase. Finally, I removed the pie chart graphic by making it into a text callout, along with adding several more key and notable stat callouts to the page. In totality, all of these added changes made my shorthand visualization better structured and more persuasive.
