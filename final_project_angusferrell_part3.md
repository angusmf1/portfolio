## Changes made since Part II
> Reflecting on the changes made from the completion of Part II to Part III.

The changes from Part II to Part III began with the results from my user research and interview feedback. I added a new section to the shorthand visualization dedicated to Harm Reduction, which highlighted the importance of Naloxone in counteracting drug-related overdoses. I included relevant facts and added a button linked to a DEA website titled "Save Lives with Naloxone". I then added an additional expert quote directly afterward addressing the benefits of harm reduction and discussing the benefits of community connections. Structurally, this expert quote and harm reduction section serve as a lead into my Call to Action. Next, I fixed the "Difference in Drug Seizure Weight" Flourish visualization by removing the data labels (initially zeros) for the first two parts of the scrollmation, then added them in for the third and final visualization. The graphic now feels more polished and complete, addressing the concerns raised in the interviews. Next, I removed the "Follow the Fentanyl Flow" intro text from the map. This was a small edit, but the intro text was redundant. 

I made several changes to my shorthand visualization based on the grading feedback comments provided on my Part II submission. First of all, I changed my reference page to generate a more standard reference style for each citation. Second, I touched up my call to action by providing clearer labels and reducing the number of buttons to a smaller, more manageable number. This should help focus my audience's attention on the resources, petitions, and legislation I want them to care about. I also made edits to my flourish line plot to highlight Fentanyl in red and put the other drugs in greyscale to further highlight its rapid increase. Finally, I removed the pie chart graphic by making it into a text callout, along with adding several more key and notable stat callouts to the page.  

I made a few stylistic changes to my shorthand by making every important number/statistic bold and highlighting it in red. This causes these stats to pop throughout the visualization and hopefully draw the audience's eyes. Next, in order to avoid plagiarism, I changed every image in my shorthand to Unsplash photos to be safe. I was able to find similar images to the ones that I had used previously, so that change was minor but beneficial. Finally, I tested my presentation using TurnItIn on Canvas to check for any issues with plagiarism. In totality, all of these added changes made my shorthand visualization better structured, more visually appealing, and more persuasive.
